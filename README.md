<h3>Abstractive summarization using bert</h3>

The main idea behind this architecture is to use the transfer learning from pretrained BERT a masked language model ,
I have replaced the Encoder part with BERT Encoder and the deocder is trained from the scratch.

One of the advantages of using Transfomer Networks is training is much faster than LSTM based models as we elimanate sequential behaviour in Transformer models.

Transformer based models generate more gramatically correct  and coherent sentences.


<h3>To run the model</h3>
<pre>
wget https://storage.googleapis.com/bert_models/2018_10_18/uncased_L-12_H-768_A-12.zip 
unzip uncased_L-12_H-768_A-12.zip

Place the story and summary files under data folder with the following names.
-train_story.txt
-train_summ.txt
-eval_story.txt
-eval_summ.txt
each story and summary must be in a single line (see sample text given.)


Step1:
Run Preprocessing
<b>python preprocess.py</b>

This creates two tfrecord files under the data folder.

Step 2:
<b>python main.py</b>

Configurations for the model can be changes from config.py file

Step 3:
Inference 
Run the command <b>python inference.py</b>
This code runs a flask server 
Use postman to send the POST request @http://your_ip_address:1118/results
with two form parameters story,summary
